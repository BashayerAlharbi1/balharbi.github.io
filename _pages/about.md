I am Bashayer Alharbi, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm part of the Computer Systems Lab and am advised by [Dr. Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io). My research areas include network security and network systems, with a specific focus on enhancing the resilience of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). I obtained my Bachelor's in Information Technology from King Abdulaziz University in 2018 and my Master's in Technology, Cybersecurity, and Policy from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2022.
